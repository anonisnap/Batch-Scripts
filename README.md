# Batch-Scripts

Simple Batch Scripts to help with small, every day tasks

## Copy & Paste

A very basic Batch Script, making use of the Windows XCOPY executable, through the use of the cmd line.
This very simply just copies the contents of one folder, and pastes them into a different folder, overwriting previous files if found
